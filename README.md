Web site: Reservation Management System.

##Characteristics of the project
Our project is a website dedicated to offering, publishing and managing different types of reservations in an easy and effective way either for those who offer their products or services or for users who request them while maintaining the protection of data and information in a secure way.
This system will allow visitors to the app to find and book different types of products/services from the web using any device at any time, filter their interests and host their reservations in a user profile.
Users who publish their products or services will be able to administer them, manage them and obtain reports of the movements of their reservations that will be useful for their balances and businesses. 

##Advantages
The system will facilitate the search in one place of all types of reservations, from real estate to vehicles, without having to go to different apps dedicated to a single category.

##Operation
To use this site you need a device with internet access.
When you start the site you will always see different categorized publications, to make a reservation users must register with their data as well as those who need to publish their goods or services to be offered for reservation.
Each registration will be stored in a database. 

## Technologies used
- Java for backend.
- API  for intercommunication (json).
- React for frontend.
- SQLite for database.

## Competition
There are several reservation systems, but only dedicated to a specific area, few are generic as we develop, is what allows us to differentiate ourselves.
Personal contribution and role in the project
As future Full Stack developers our goals are that we will each develop various front-end and back-end.
